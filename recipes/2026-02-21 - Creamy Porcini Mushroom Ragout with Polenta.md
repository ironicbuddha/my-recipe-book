## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- Rehydrating porcini creates a dual input: umami-rich solids plus aromatic extraction liquid.
- Thyme performs best when split: a short hot infusion in Phase A, then a fresh addition in Phase D for top-note aroma.
- Mushroom browning followed by controlled reduction concentrates glutamates while retaining enough liquid for a spoonable sauce.
- Firm, fully cooked polenta sets as starches hydrate and cool; chilling before frying improves clean edges and crust development.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Polenta falls apart during frying.
- Likely cause: Polenta undercooked or insufficient chill/set time.
- Corrective action: Cook until very thick and tender, then chill at least 2 hours before cutting.

- Symptom: Mushrooms taste steamed rather than savory.
- Likely cause: Pan overcrowding or low heat during initial saute.
- Corrective action: Use a wide pan and cook at medium-high heat so moisture evaporates quickly.

- Symptom: Polenta is lumpy.
- Likely cause: Polenta added too quickly or not whisked during hydration.
- Corrective action: Stream polenta gradually into actively whisked liquid.

- Symptom: Fried polenta is pale and soft.
- Likely cause: Pan not hot enough or pieces moved too early.
- Corrective action: Preheat pan fully and allow a stable crust to form before turning.

- Symptom: Thyme flavour is muddy or dull.
- Likely cause: Thyme cooked too long in cream.
- Corrective action: Add most thyme near the end and simmer briefly.
