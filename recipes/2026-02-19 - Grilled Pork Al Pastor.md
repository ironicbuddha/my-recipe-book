## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- Bromelain activity in pineapple can soften muscle proteins; grilling the pineapple and keeping marination time bounded reduces uncontrolled proteolysis and surface mush.
- High-heat hibachi contact accelerates Maillard reaction on exposed pork surfaces, building roasted aromatics and color.
- Pork fillet (lean) has lower fat buffering and narrower thermal tolerance than shoulder; fillet requires stricter endpoint control to avoid dryness.
- Salt in the salsa suppresses perceived sweetness and sharpens acidity, improving balance against caramelized fruit sugars.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Exterior burns before center reaches 60 C.
- Likely cause: Excessive grate temperature or insufficient turning frequency.
- Corrective action: Raise grate distance, reduce local fuel intensity, turn every 45-60 seconds.

- Symptom: Pork texture is dry and chalky.
- Likely cause: Internal temperature exceeded target range or post-slice rechar time was too long.
- Corrective action: Pull at 60-62 C, verify probe placement, and limit second char pass to 15-30 seconds.

- Symptom: Salsa tastes flat or too sweet.
- Likely cause: Low acid/salt balance or insufficient resting time.
- Corrective action: Increase lime and salt incrementally, then rest 10 minutes and reassess.
