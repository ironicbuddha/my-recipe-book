## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- For a slightly thicker body, blend 1–2 ladles of soup and return to the pot.
- Lemon provides brighter acidity; red wine vinegar gives deeper earthiness. Choose based on mood.
- The finishing olive oil and acid must be added at the end to preserve aroma and brightness — cooking destroys the volatile compounds you're paying for.
- Keeps well refrigerated for 3–4 days; reheat gently and refresh with additional lemon and olive oil before serving.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Soup tastes flat and one-dimensional.
- Likely cause: Acid and raw olive oil skipped or added too early (cooked out).
- Corrective action: Always finish off heat. The acid and oil are not optional — they are the dish.

- Symptom: Lentils are mushy and have lost all texture.
- Likely cause: Overcooked or boiled too aggressively.
- Corrective action: Maintain gentle simmer. Check at 35 minutes — lentils should be tender but hold shape.

- Symptom: Bitter, harsh undertone.
- Likely cause: Lentils not rinsed properly, or optional pre-boil skipped on older stock.
- Corrective action: Rinse until water runs clear. Pre-boil and drain if lentils are old or dusty.

- Symptom: Broth is too thin.
- Likely cause: Too much liquid or insufficient cook time for starch release.
- Corrective action: Simmer longer uncovered, or blend a portion and stir back in.
