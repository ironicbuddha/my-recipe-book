## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- The vinegar tightens the tomatoes — without it the dish reads as flat and sweet.
- Fresh coriander and ginger at the finish give verticality against the long-cooked base.
- The finishing olive oil rounds edges and adds richness without heaviness.
- Maillard reaction on the lamb is non-negotiable — this is your depth. No crowding the pot.
- Splitting the toasted coriander between Phase C (cooked in) and Phase F (added fresh) creates aromatic layering — the same spice at two different stages reads as complexity.
- Potato starch and gelatin from the lamb neck thicken the gravy naturally. No flour needed.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Gravy is thin and soupy.
- Likely cause: Too much liquid during braise, or potatoes not given enough uncovered simmer time.
- Corrective action: Keep liquid tight during braise. Simmer uncovered in Phase E until sauce is thick and clingy.

- Symptom: Lamb is tough and chewy.
- Likely cause: Insufficient braise time or heat too high.
- Corrective action: Low simmer for a full 90–120 minutes. Neck should be collapsing, not resisting.

- Symptom: Dish tastes flat despite seasoning.
- Likely cause: Skipped the finishing phase — no acid, no fresh aromatics.
- Corrective action: Phase F is not optional. Vinegar, fresh ginger, reserved coriander, and parsley are the difference between good and great.

- Symptom: Spices taste raw and powdery.
- Likely cause: Spice bloom skipped or too brief.
- Corrective action: Toast whole spices properly. Bloom ground spices in fat for a full 30–60 seconds before adding liquid.
