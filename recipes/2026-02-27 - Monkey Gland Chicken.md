## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- Dry skin + hard sear drive browning (Maillard reaction) for savory depth that balances the sweet-tangy sauce.
- Gentle simmer reduces water and concentrates sugar/acid/salt, creating a glossy glaze that clings to the chicken.
- Resting after roasting stabilizes juices; glazing after rest keeps the skin crispier than saucing early.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Pale, rubbery skin.
- Likely cause: Skin not dried; pan not hot enough; poor skin contact.
- Corrective action: Pat very dry, preheat pan, press skin-side down, and don't move chicken until it releases.

- Symptom: Sauce is thin and watery.
- Likely cause: Under-reduced or too much water added.
- Corrective action: Simmer longer at a gentle bubble until it coats a spoon; add water only to control thickness.

- Symptom: Sauce tastes flat or cloyingly sweet.
- Likely cause: Not enough acid/salt/umami to balance chutney/ketchup.
- Corrective action: Add vinegar for brightness and soy/Worcestershire for depth; simmer 1–2 min and re-taste.

- Symptom: Chicken is dry.
- Likely cause: Overcooked beyond 74 C or held hot too long before serving.
- Corrective action: Pull at 74 C, rest briefly, and glaze just before serving.
