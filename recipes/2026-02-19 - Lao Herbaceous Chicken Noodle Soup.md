## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- Blanching wing tips removes blood proteins and impurities, ensuring a clear broth. Skipping this step produces a cloudy, livery stock.
- Gentle simmering (never boiling) keeps the broth clear — rolling boils emulsify fat and particulates into permanent haze.
- Wing tips provide collagen-rich body that the whole chicken alone cannot deliver in this timeframe.
- The two jeow function as independent condiment layers — red brings smoky depth, green brings sharp freshness. They should not be combined.
- Straining without pressing solids preserves clarity; pressing extracts starch and fine particulates.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Broth is cloudy and greasy.
- Likely cause: Stock was boiled rather than simmered, or solids were pressed during straining.
- Corrective action: Maintain gentle simmer throughout. Strain through fine sieve without pressing.

- Symptom: Chicken is dry and stringy.
- Likely cause: Overcooked — left in simmering broth too long.
- Corrective action: Remove chicken at 45–55 minutes and rest before shredding. Residual heat finishes carryover.

- Symptom: Red jeow tastes bitter and acrid.
- Likely cause: Chillies burnt during toasting.
- Corrective action: Toast over medium heat, moving constantly. Remove at first sign of fragrance, not colour change.

- Symptom: Soup tastes flat despite seasoning.
- Likely cause: Insufficient acid or condiment balance at the bowl stage.
- Corrective action: Add lime juice and a spoonful of jeow. Fish sauce for salt, acid for lift.
