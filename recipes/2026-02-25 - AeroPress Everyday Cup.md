# AEROPRESS EVERYDAY CUP

Yield: 1 cup (~230 g)
Portions: 1
Target Water Temperature: 92 C

Primary Ingredient Basis: `15 g coffee = 100%`

Simple and sweet daily profile: balanced body, low bitterness, easy repeatability.

## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- Full-volume immersion with moderate grind supports even extraction and reliable sweetness.
- A short stir keeps the slurry uniform without excessive fines movement.
- Gentle 30-second press reduces channeling and bitterness at the end of extraction.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Sour, thin cup.
- Likely cause: Grind too coarse, steep too short, or water below target temperature.
- Corrective action: Grind finer, keep full 2-minute steep, and brew at 92 C.

- Symptom: Bitter, hollow finish.
- Likely cause: Grind too fine or pressing through the final high-resistance stage.
- Corrective action: Coarsen grind slightly and stop pressing when resistance sharply increases.

- Symptom: Inconsistent strength across brews.
- Likely cause: Unstable pour mass or variable steep timing.
- Corrective action: Use a scale and timer for repeatable dose, water mass, and contact time.
