## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- Sous vide ensures uniform pasteurisation and controlled protein denaturation.
- Overnight refrigeration dehydrates the surface, increasing Maillard efficiency and reducing flare-ups.
- High-heat searing triggers rapid browning without further internal cooking.
- Acid in both greens and sauce balances pork fat and paprika sweetness.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Pale crust.
- Likely cause: Surface moisture not removed.
- Corrective action: Extend uncovered refrigeration or pat dry more thoroughly.

- Symptom: Excess smoke and flare-ups.
- Likely cause: Surface fat or sugar igniting.
- Corrective action: Use neutral oil lightly; avoid sugary rub components.

- Symptom: Dry pork.
- Likely cause: Internal temperature exceeded 63 C.
- Corrective action: Pull earlier; trust carryover.
