## STRUCTURAL NOTES

Cornstarch gelatinises at ~95 °C.  
Filling must visibly bubble to ensure full activation.  
Underbaked fruit pie = starch not fully set → runny slice.  
Lattice improves evaporation and prevents trapped steam.  
Sour cherries provide natural acidity; sugar is restrained for balance.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Runny filling.
  - Likely cause: Insufficient internal temperature.
  - Corrective action: Bake until sustained bubbling; verify ~96 °C.

- Symptom: Gummy texture.
  - Likely cause: Excess starch.
  - Corrective action: Reduce cornstarch by 5–10%.

- Symptom: Soggy bottom.
  - Likely cause: Excess cherry liquid.
  - Corrective action: Drain cherries slightly; maintain high initial heat.
