# Recipes

Canonical dishes in Modernist Kitchen house style.

Naming:
`YYYY-MM-DD - Dish Name.md`

Rules:
- Use `templates/Recipe - Template.md`.
- Include YAML frontmatter and `version`.
- Use PHASE sections in chronological order.
- Use metric units only (`g`, `ml`, `C`).
- Define a primary mass basis and percentage scaling.
- For linearly scalable dishes, use a 2-portion canonical base.
- Keep fixed-yield sizing only for batch-constrained formats (e.g., full pies, slab brownies).
