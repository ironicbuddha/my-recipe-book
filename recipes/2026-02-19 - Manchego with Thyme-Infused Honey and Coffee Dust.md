## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- The coffee should read as a whisper of roast, not a headline. If the bitterness dominates, you've used too much.
- Medium roast works better than dark — dark roast tastes like carbon and regret.
- Aged Manchego (12+ months) is essential; young cheese lacks the crystalline texture and concentrated flavour needed to stand up to the bitterness.
- Warming honey to 40–45 C increases fluidity and volatilises thyme aromatics without degrading flavour compounds. Exceeding 50 C risks cooked-herb bitterness and dulled floral notes.
- Coffee dust operates below conscious flavour threshold — it should register as roast complexity, not as coffee per se.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Coffee flavour dominates the plate.
- Likely cause: Excessive coffee dust or grind too coarse (larger particles deliver more concentrated hits).
- Corrective action: Reduce to a bare pinch; sift more aggressively to remove coarse particles.

- Symptom: Honey tastes flat or cloying.
- Likely cause: Honey not warm enough to volatilise thyme aromatics, or infusion time too short.
- Corrective action: Warm to 40–45 C and infuse a full 15 min. Use wildflower or thyme-origin honey for better baseline complexity.

- Symptom: Cheese tastes rubbery and muted.
- Likely cause: Served too cold — fat crystallisation suppresses flavour release and texture.
- Corrective action: Ensure full 45–60 min tempering at room temperature before serving.

## OPTIONAL REFINEMENTS

- Add a tiny flake of sea salt to sharpen contrast.
- Try blooming the coffee powder in a dry pan for 20 seconds to soften acidity.
- A dry fino sherry alongside this is outrageously good.
