## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- Poaching temperature control is critical; boiling tightens muscle fibres and reduces juiciness. Hold at 85–90 C.
- Air-drying is the structural key to blistered skin. Moisture equals oil splatter and soft skin.
- Dark soy contributes colour more than salt; do not substitute entirely with light soy.
- Master stock can be strained, cooled, and frozen for reuse. Each iteration deepens flavour.
- The cornflour dusting creates micro-texture on the skin surface that promotes blistering during frying.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Skin is soft and pale after frying.
- Likely cause: Insufficient drying time — surface moisture prevented crisping.
- Corrective action: Dry uncovered in refrigerator a full 8–12 hours. Skin should feel papery before dusting.

- Symptom: Meat is dry and stringy.
- Likely cause: Poaching liquid was at a rolling boil, or chicken was left in stock too long.
- Corrective action: Maintain 85–90 C. Pull at 72–75 C internal at the thigh. Use a probe thermometer.

- Symptom: Oil spatters violently when chicken enters fryer.
- Likely cause: Surface moisture or condensation from inadequate drying.
- Corrective action: Pat dry, ensure thorough air-drying, and lower chicken into oil slowly.

- Symptom: Colour is uneven — dark patches and pale spots.
- Likely cause: Insufficient rotation during frying.
- Corrective action: Rotate every 90 seconds. Use enough oil to submerge or ladle continuously.

## VARIATIONS

- **Marylands Only**: Use 1200 g bone-in thighs; reduce poach time to ~25 min.
- **Extra Crisp**: Double fry — 160 C for 4 min, rest 5 min, then 190 C for 2–3 min.
- **Chilli Finish**: Serve with ginger-scallion oil and fermented chilli paste.
