## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- Caramelization and Maillard reactions during grilling create sweet-bitter complexity that balances the high-acidity dipping sauce.
- The sugar-to-fish-sauce ratio in both marinade and sauce drives Hanoi's signature sweet-salty equilibrium.
- Fresh herbs function as aromatic contrast and palate cleanser, preventing fat saturation.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Pork tastes flat.
- Likely cause: Under-seasoned marinade or insufficient caramelization.
- Corrective action: Increase fish sauce slightly; grill hotter.

- Symptom: Sauce too harsh or salty.
- Likely cause: Imbalanced sugar-acid ratio.
- Corrective action: Adjust with small increments of sugar or water.

- Symptom: Dry patties.
- Likely cause: Overcooking beyond 70 C.
- Corrective action: Pull at 68 C and rest.
