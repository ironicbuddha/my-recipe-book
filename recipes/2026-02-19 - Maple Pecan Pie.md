## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- Custard sets via egg protein coagulation at ~82–90 C.
- Sugar delays coagulation; excess sugar slows set.
- Extra yolk increases lecithin and protein density, improving slice integrity.
- Verjuice provides acid lift without destabilising custard.
- High initial heat locks crust lamination before butter fully melts.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Runny centre.
- Likely cause: Excess sugar or insufficient internal temp.
- Corrective action: Reduce sugar or bake to 88 C centre.

- Symptom: Overbrowned crust.
- Likely cause: Excessive initial heat or prolonged exposure.
- Corrective action: Shield rim earlier; reduce initial temp slightly.

- Symptom: Custard curdled.
- Likely cause: Overbake above 90 C.
- Corrective action: Lower finish temp; remove at controlled wobble.
