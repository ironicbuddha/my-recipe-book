## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- The ice bath after poaching shocks the skin, tightening collagen into a firm gel layer that gives Hainanese chicken its characteristic silky-bouncy texture.
- Resting the chicken in residual heat (heat off, lid on) provides gentle carryover cooking without tightening muscle fibres.
- Cooking rice in chicken stock with rendered fat is the entire point — plain water rice is a different dish.
- The ginger sauce relies on hot oil to bloom volatile aromatics on contact. Lukewarm oil produces a flat, raw-tasting paste.
- Chilli sauce should balance heat, acid, and sweetness — if any one dominates, the trinity of sauces loses its purpose.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Chicken skin is flabby and gelatinous.
- Likely cause: Ice bath skipped or too brief.
- Corrective action: Submerge fully in ice water for a full 5 minutes immediately after poaching.

- Symptom: Chicken meat is dry and stringy.
- Likely cause: Simmered too aggressively or too long.
- Corrective action: Maintain bare simmer (not rolling boil). Pull at 30–35 min and rest in liquid off heat.

- Symptom: Rice is greasy and clumpy.
- Likely cause: Too much fat, or garlic and ginger were browned (releasing bitter compounds).
- Corrective action: Use 2% fat ratio. Cook aromatics gently — fragrant, not coloured.

- Symptom: Ginger sauce tastes raw and harsh.
- Likely cause: Oil was not hot enough when poured over ginger.
- Corrective action: Oil must be shimmering (~180 C). The sizzle on contact is the bloom.
