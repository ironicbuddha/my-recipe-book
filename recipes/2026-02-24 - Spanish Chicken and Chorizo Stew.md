## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- Browning chicken and rendering chorizo builds a fat-and-fond base that carries smoked paprika and cumin.
- Red wine reduced to a glaze concentrates fruit/tannin and becomes the backbone of the sauce once tomatoes hit the pot.
- Blooming spices in fat prevents raw, dusty flavour and distributes heat evenly through the stew.
- Beans go in late to avoid chalky skins and blowout; they should read as creamy and intact.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Sauce is thin and soupy.
- Likely cause: Too much added water, simmer too low/short, or pot covered the entire time.
- Corrective action: Uncover and simmer to tighten; next time add less water and reduce wine to a true glaze.

- Symptom: Stew tastes harsh and bitter.
- Likely cause: Burnt spices or garlic, or wine reduced too hard at high heat.
- Corrective action: Bloom spices briefly on medium (30–60 seconds) and add wine before anything scorches.

- Symptom: Chicken is tight/dry.
- Likely cause: Browning too far into doneness and then over-stewing at a hard boil.
- Corrective action: Brown for colour, then stew at a gentle simmer; stop when thighs are tender (~85 C texture endpoint).

- Symptom: Beans are broken/mushy.
- Likely cause: Added too early and boiled aggressively.
- Corrective action: Add beans only for final 8–10 minutes and keep simmer gentle.
