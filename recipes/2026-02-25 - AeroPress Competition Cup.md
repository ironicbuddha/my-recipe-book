# AEROPRESS COMPETITION CUP

Yield: 1 cup (200-220 g)
Portions: 1
Target Water Temperature: 90-94 C

Primary Ingredient Basis: `18 g coffee = 100%`

Modern high-clarity profile: fruit-forward acidity, low sludge, precise dilution.

## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- Short contact time and moderate-fine grind create a clean, high-extraction concentrate without extended bitterness.
- Controlled agitation limits fines suspension and reduces sludge in the final cup.
- Bypass dilution sets final strength while preserving high-frequency aromatics and acidity.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Flat, dull cup with low acidity.
- Likely cause: Water temperature too low, grind too coarse, or insufficient concentrate strength.
- Corrective action: Raise brew water toward 94 C and tighten grind slightly.

- Symptom: Harsh bitterness or drying finish.
- Likely cause: Excessive agitation, long steep, or overly fine grind.
- Corrective action: Reduce stir time to 5 seconds, keep total steep under 90 seconds, and coarsen grind slightly.

- Symptom: Muddy mouthfeel.
- Likely cause: Pressed too fast, forcing fines through.
- Corrective action: Extend plunge to 20-30 seconds with steady, gentle pressure.
