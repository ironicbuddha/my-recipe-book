## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- Potato starch in the GF mix is critical for long-lasting crispness — it dehydrates more completely than wheat flour during frying.
- Batter temperature should remain cold until frying; cold batter hitting hot oil creates more violent steam release, building a rougher, crispier surface.
- The first fry at 160 C cooks the chicken through and sets the starch structure. The second fry at 185–190 C dehydrates the crust for lasting crunch.
- Sauce should coat, not soak — excess sauce will soften the crust. Half-sauced service preserves textural contrast.
- Sesame oil is added off heat to preserve its volatile aromatics.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Coating falls off during frying.
- Likely cause: Batter too thick or chicken not rested after coating.
- Corrective action: Thin batter to lightly runny consistency. Rest coated chicken 5 min before first fry.

- Symptom: Crisp coating goes soggy within minutes of saucing.
- Likely cause: Too much sauce, or sauce applied to insufficiently drained chicken.
- Corrective action: Drain chicken thoroughly after second fry. Toss in sauce — do not drown. Serve immediately.

- Symptom: Chicken is cooked through but coating is pale and soft.
- Likely cause: Second fry skipped or oil temperature too low.
- Corrective action: Second fry at 185–190 C is non-negotiable. Fry until deeply golden and audibly crisp.

- Symptom: Sauce tastes harsh and one-dimensional.
- Likely cause: Insufficient simmer time or missing acid balance.
- Corrective action: Simmer a full 2–3 min to meld flavours. Adjust vinegar and honey for sweet-sour balance.
