## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- Butter is a fat-continuous emulsion; it melts cleanly and can be substituted by mass in many baked goods without changing hydration.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Scorched/burnt flavours in the finished dish.
- Likely cause: Overheating butter during melting or cooking.
- Corrective action: Use gentler heat; melt slowly and avoid browning unless intentional.
