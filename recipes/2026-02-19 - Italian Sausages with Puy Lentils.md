## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- Browning the sausages without piercing preserves internal fat and moisture; the casing acts as a barrier during braising.
- Sweating the mirepoix without colour builds sweetness without bitterness — this is a foundation layer, not a flavour accent.
- Red wine vinegar is added early and reduced to mellow its sharpness; it provides background acidity that lifts the earthy lentils.
- Cinnamon and star anise in the tomato sauce are warm spice accents — they should whisper, not shout.
- Puy lentils hold their shape under braising better than red or yellow varieties; do not substitute with split lentils.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Sausages are dry and split open.
- Likely cause: Pierced during browning or braised at too high a temperature.
- Corrective action: Never pierce. Brown over medium heat and braise at a gentle simmer.

- Symptom: Lentils are mushy and have lost all structure.
- Likely cause: Overcooked or wrong lentil variety used.
- Corrective action: Use Puy or Castelluccio lentils. Check at 20 minutes — they should be tender but hold shape.

- Symptom: Tomato sauce tastes raw and acidic.
- Likely cause: Insufficient simmer time for the tomatoes.
- Corrective action: Simmer a full 15–20 minutes. The sauce should be slightly thickened and mellow before combining.

- Symptom: Dish tastes flat despite seasoning.
- Likely cause: Missing finishing acid or olive oil.
- Corrective action: Check acidity — a small splash of vinegar at the end sharpens everything. Raw olive oil adds richness and aroma.
