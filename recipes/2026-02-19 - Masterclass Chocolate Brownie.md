## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- High fat and relatively low flour limit gluten development, producing a dense fudgy crumb rather than a cakey structure.
- The crackled surface forms from dissolved sugar rising and creating a thin meringue-like film during baking.
- Pulling the brownie at 88–92 C preserves internal moisture while ensuring protein coagulation and starch gelation are complete.
- Cooling is not optional — the starch and fat matrix needs time to set. Cutting early yields a gooey mess instead of clean fudgy squares.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Cakey, dry crumb with no fudge character.
- Likely cause: Overbaked or eggs over-whipped incorporating too much air.
- Corrective action: Pull at 88–92 C with visible wobble. Whisk eggs only to glossy, not to ribbon stage.

- Symptom: No crackled top surface.
- Likely cause: Sugar not fully dissolved into eggs before folding in chocolate.
- Corrective action: Whisk sugar and eggs longer until glossy and slightly thickened — the sugar film needs dissolved sugar at the surface.

- Symptom: Dense, greasy texture with no structure.
- Likely cause: Chocolate mixture too hot when combined with eggs, breaking the emulsion.
- Corrective action: Cool chocolate-butter mixture to ~45 C before folding into egg-sugar base.
