## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- Hydration (milk + egg relative to flour) is approximately 184%.
- Fat (butter + egg fat) is approximately 50% of flour weight.
- Sugar is modest — structure remains tender, not cake-like.
- This ratio gives you a classic diner flapjack: soft interior, mild tang, moderate browning.
- If you bump hydration above 200%, you move toward crepe territory.
- If you increase fat above 35% butter alone, you approach cake crumb.
- If you cut sugar below 10%, browning suffers.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Flat, dense pancakes with no lift.
- Likely cause: Overmixed batter developed too much gluten, or leavening is expired.
- Corrective action: Fold only until just combined — lumps are fine. Test baking powder freshness in hot water.

- Symptom: Raw centre, burnt exterior.
- Likely cause: Pan too hot; batter too thick from insufficient hydration.
- Corrective action: Reduce to medium heat (175–185 C surface). Do not spread the batter — let it flow naturally.

- Symptom: Rubbery, tough texture.
- Likely cause: Overmixing activated gluten network beyond desired threshold.
- Corrective action: Mix with fewer strokes. Rest the batter to relax gluten before cooking.
