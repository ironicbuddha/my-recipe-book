## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- Pinto beans yield creamier interior; navy beans produce tighter structure.
- Molasses provides bitterness and mineral depth; balance with vinegar if overly sweet.
- Fond development during beef browning is critical for depth — do not rush this step.
- Blooming spices in rendered fat unlocks fat-soluble flavour compounds that water alone won't extract.
- Extended holding improves integration; flavour peaks on day two.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Beans are mushy and have lost all structure.
- Likely cause: Over-soaked or over-simmered in Phase A before baking.
- Corrective action: Simmer only until just tender (slight bite remaining). The oven phase finishes them.

- Symptom: Sauce is thin and watery after baking.
- Likely cause: Too much liquid added, or insufficient bake time.
- Corrective action: Continue uncovered baking. Liquid should just cover beans at start — not submerge them.

- Symptom: Scorched bottom, uneven texture.
- Likely cause: Oven too hot or insufficient stirring during long bake.
- Corrective action: Reduce to 160–170 C, stir every 30–45 min, and ensure pot is heavy-bottomed.

- Symptom: Flat, one-dimensional flavour.
- Likely cause: Skipped fond development or spice bloom.
- Corrective action: Brown meat aggressively before proceeding. Bloom spices a full 60 seconds in fat.

## VARIATIONS

- **Campfire Version**: Replace 50% beer with strong coffee.
- **Smokier**: Add 5 g chipotle powder or 1 diced canned chipotle.
- **Lean Ranch**: Omit beef; increase bacon to 300 g.
- **Brisket Leftover Edition**: Replace beef with 300 g chopped smoked brisket.
