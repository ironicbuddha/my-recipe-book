## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- Thin slicing across the grain shortens muscle fibers, increasing perceived tenderness.
- High heat promotes rapid Maillard browning before internal overcooking occurs.
- Lemongrass contributes citral-driven brightness that offsets beef fat.
- Nước chấm rebalances sweetness, salinity, and acidity in real time at the table.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Tough beef.
- Likely cause: Incorrect slicing direction or overcooking.
- Corrective action: Slice perpendicular to grain; grill very briefly.

- Symptom: Burnt exterior, raw interior.
- Likely cause: Excess sugar pooling.
- Corrective action: Shake off excess marinade before grilling.

- Symptom: Sauce tastes flat.
- Likely cause: Acid-sugar imbalance.
- Corrective action: Adjust lime or sugar incrementally.
