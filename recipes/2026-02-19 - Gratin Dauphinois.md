>> ### Components
>> | Ingredient | Quantity | Scaling |
>> | --- | --- | --- |
>> | Waxy potatoes | 500 g | 100.00% |
>> | Fine salt | 6 g | 1.20% |
>> | White pepper | 0.5 g | 0.10% |
>> | Garlic (finely grated) | 4 g | 0.80% |
>> | Unsalted butter (for dish) | 7.5 g | 1.50% |

>> [!col-right]
>> ### Method
>> 1. Preheat oven to 170 C (no fan).
>> 2. Slice potatoes 2–3 mm thick using a mandoline. Do not rinse.
>> 3. Combine salt, pepper, and garlic.
>> 4. Butter shallow baking dish thoroughly.

## PHASE B — ASSEMBLY

>> ### Components
>> | Ingredient | Quantity | Scaling |
>> | --- | --- | --- |
>> | Heavy cream (35%) | 350 g | 70.00% |

>> [!col-right]
>> ### Method
>> 1. Warm cream gently to ~40 C (optional but stabilising).
>> 2. Layer potatoes tightly and evenly.
>> 3. Pour cream over until just covered.
>> 4. Tap dish lightly to release trapped air pockets.

>> 1. Cover loosely with foil.
>> 2. Bake 45 min (structure set).
>> 3. Remove foil and bake 30–40 min more.
>> 4. Target internal temperature 93–96 C.
>> 5. Top lightly golden; centre fully tender.

## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- Potato starch gelatinises at 65–70 C, naturally thickening the cream without flour.
- Excess heat may cause cream separation — 170 C with no fan maintains gentle, even convection.
- Traditional dauphinois contains no cheese. This is the hill we die on.
- Resting is mandatory for structural cohesion and clean slicing; the starch network needs time to set.
- Do not rinse sliced potatoes — surface starch is the binding agent.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Cream has split and looks grainy.
- Likely cause: Oven temperature too high or fan convection creating hot spots.
- Corrective action: Reduce to 160–170 C, no fan. Ensure foil coverage for initial bake.

- Symptom: Centre still raw, top already dark.
- Likely cause: Potato slices too thick or layers too tightly packed restricting cream penetration.
- Corrective action: Slice 2–3 mm consistently with mandoline. Ensure cream reaches every layer.

- Symptom: Gratin collapses into mush when sliced.
- Likely cause: Insufficient resting time — starch network hasn't set.
- Corrective action: Rest a full 30 min minimum. Patience isn't optional here.
