## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- Potato starch gelatinises at 65–70 C, naturally thickening the cream without flour.
- Excess heat may cause cream separation — 170 C with no fan maintains gentle, even convection.
- Traditional dauphinois contains no cheese. This is the hill we die on.
- Resting is mandatory for structural cohesion and clean slicing; the starch network needs time to set.
- Do not rinse sliced potatoes — surface starch is the binding agent.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Cream has split and looks grainy.
- Likely cause: Oven temperature too high or fan convection creating hot spots.
- Corrective action: Reduce to 160–170 C, no fan. Ensure foil coverage for initial bake.

- Symptom: Centre still raw, top already dark.
- Likely cause: Potato slices too thick or layers too tightly packed restricting cream penetration.
- Corrective action: Slice 2–3 mm consistently with mandoline. Ensure cream reaches every layer.

- Symptom: Gratin collapses into mush when sliced.
- Likely cause: Insufficient resting time — starch network hasn't set.
- Corrective action: Rest a full 30 min minimum. Patience isn't optional here.
