## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- Rendering guanciale slowly extracts fat without scorching proteins, preventing bitterness.
- The sauce relies on emulsification: rendered pork fat + tomato solids + starch-rich pasta water form a stable, glossy coating.
- Salt balance is critical — olives, capers, and cured pork already provide significant salinity.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Sauce feels greasy and separated.
- Likely cause: Insufficient pasta water or inadequate tossing.
- Corrective action: Add small increments of hot pasta water and agitate vigorously.

- Symptom: Sauce tastes flat.
- Likely cause: Tomatoes under-reduced.
- Corrective action: Extend simmer to concentrate flavour.

- Symptom: Guanciale tough or burnt.
- Likely cause: Heat too high during rendering.
- Corrective action: Start from cold pan and render gently.
