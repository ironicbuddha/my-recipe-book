# SOURDOUGH BREAD

Yield: 2 loaves (~900 g each)
Portions: 16
Target Internal Temperature: 98 C

Primary Ingredient Basis: `1100 g bread flour = 100%`

Lean naturally leavened sourdough with staged fermentation, fold-based strength building, and covered-then-uncovered dutch oven bake.


---

## PHASE A — BUILD LEVAIN (8 HOURS)

---

> [!col]
>> [!col-left]
>> ### Components
>> | Ingredient | Quantity | Scaling |
>> | --- | --- | --- |
>> | Mature sourdough starter | 20 g | 1.82% |
>> | Bread flour | 100 g | 9.09% |
>> | Tepid water | 100 g | 9.09% |
>
>> [!col-right]
>> ### Method
>> 1. Mix starter, flour, and tepid water until homogeneous.
>> 2. Cover and ferment at room temperature for about 8 hours, until expanded and active.


---

## PHASE B — MIX DOUGH & INITIAL REST (30 MINUTES TO 4 HOURS)

---

> [!col]
>> [!col-left]
>> ### Components
>> | Ingredient | Quantity | Scaling |
>> | --- | --- | --- |
>> | Ripe levain (from Phase A) | all | — |
>> | Bread flour | 1000 g | 90.91% |
>> | Tepid water | 600 g | 54.55% |
>
>> [!col-right]
>> ### Method
>> 1. Combine water and ripe levain in a large bowl.
>> 2. Add flour and mix until no dry pockets remain.
>> 3. Cover and rest for 30 minutes to 4 hours in a warm place.


---

## PHASE C — ADD SALT (15 MINUTES)

---

> [!col]
>> [!col-left]
>> ### Components
>> | Ingredient | Quantity | Scaling |
>> | --- | --- | --- |
>> | Sea salt | 20 g | 1.82% |
>> | Water | 40 g | 3.64% |
>
>> [!col-right]
>> ### Method
>> 1. Dissolve sea salt in water.
>> 2. Add the salt solution to the dough.
>> 3. Mix and squeeze the dough until fully combined, about 15 minutes.


---

## PHASE D — STRETCH & FOLD SERIES (90 MINUTES)

---

>> ### Components
>> | Ingredient | Quantity | Scaling |
>> | --- | --- | --- |
>> | Salted dough (from Phase C) | all | — |
>
>> [!col-right]
>> ### Method
>> 1. Perform one full stretch-and-fold set.
>> 2. Rest 30 minutes.
>> 3. Repeat for a total of 3 sets over 90 minutes.


---

## PHASE E — BULK PROOF (2 TO 3 HOURS)

---

>> | Ingredient | Quantity | Scaling |
>> | --- | --- | --- |
>> | Dough (from Phase D) | all | — |
>
>> [!col-right]
>> ### Method
>> 1. Keep dough in a warm place and allow bulk fermentation for 2 to 3 hours.
>> 2. Dough should look aerated and rise visibly before dividing.


---

## PHASE F — DIVIDE & BENCH REST (30 MINUTES)

---

>> [!col-left]
>> ### Components
>> | Ingredient | Quantity | Scaling |
>> | --- | --- | --- |
>> | Bulk-fermented dough | all | — |
>
>> [!col-right]
>> ### Method
>> 1. Turn dough out and divide into 2 equal pieces.
>> 2. Pre-shape each piece into a tight round.
>> 3. Rest 30 minutes, covered, to relax gluten.


---

## PHASE G — FINAL SHAPE & FINAL PROOF

---

> [!col]
>> [!col-left]
>> ### Components
>> | Ingredient | Quantity | Scaling |
>> | --- | --- | --- |
>> | Rested dough rounds | 2 pieces | — |
>
>> [!col-right]
>> ### Method
>> 1. Shape each dough piece and place seam-side up in proofing bowls.
>> 2. Proof 2 to 3 hours at room temperature, or retard overnight in the refrigerator.
>> 3. If retarding, place plastic wrap directly over the dough surface.


---

## PHASE H — PREHEAT OVEN & VESSEL (20 MINUTES)

---

> [!col]
>> [!col-left]
>> ### Components
>> | Ingredient | Quantity | Scaling |
>> | --- | --- | --- |
>> | Oven temperature | 240 C | — |
>> | Lidded casserole or dutch oven | 1 | — |
>
>> [!col-right]
>> ### Method
>> 1. Heat oven to 240 C.
>> 2. Place lidded casserole dish in the oven and preheat at least 20 minutes.


---

## PHASE I — BAKE (40 MINUTES)

---

> [!col]
>> [!col-left]
>> ### Components
>> | Ingredient | Quantity | Scaling |
>> | --- | --- | --- |
>> | Proofed dough | 1 loaf per bake | — |
>> | Parchment paper | as needed | — |
>
>> [!col-right]
>> ### Method
>> 1. Transfer loaf onto parchment, score, and lower into the hot casserole dish.
>> 2. Cover with lid and bake.
>> 3. Remove lid for the last 10 minutes to brown the crust.
>> 4. Total bake time is about 40 minutes per loaf.
>> 5. Cool completely before slicing.

## STRUCTURAL NOTES

- This formula is approximately 67% hydration when counting flour and water added directly to the dough and levain.
- Salt is added after initial hydration to allow easier gluten development early in mixing.
- Repeated folds strengthen dough structure without intensive mechanical kneading.
- Covered baking traps steam, promoting oven spring before dry heat sets crust color.

## FAILURE MODES

- Symptom: Dense loaf with low rise.
- Likely cause: Under-fermented levain or insufficient bulk proof.
- Corrective action: Extend fermentation and confirm levain is fully active before mixing.

- Symptom: Dough spreads flat during shaping.
- Likely cause: Weak gluten or overproofing.
- Corrective action: Add one extra fold set in Phase D and shorten final proof.

- Symptom: Pale, soft crust.
- Likely cause: Lid removed too late or oven temperature too low.
- Corrective action: Verify 240 C preheat and keep the final uncovered 10 minutes.

- Symptom: Gummy crumb.
- Likely cause: Underbaked center or slicing while hot.
- Corrective action: Bake to an internal temperature near 98 C and cool fully before cutting.
